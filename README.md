# DeepDream

DeepDream is a computer vision program created by Google engineer Alexander Mordvintsev, which uses neural networks to create dream-like hallucinogenic, psychedelic artifacts in images.

This project allows users to generate DeepDream images offline on their phones, using the camera or selecting an image from the gallery.

While the core functionality is offline, a one-time download (around 90 MB) is required.
